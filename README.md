Telecom Churn Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts whether a customer is likely to leave a telecom service provider based on usage patterns, service details, and customer demographics. The project involves data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation to help business reduce customer attrition.
Telecom Churn Prediction aims to identify customers who are likely to churn using historical telecom customer data. The project includes end-to-end machine learning workflow starting from data cleaning and EDA to feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.
Multiple machine learning models such as LogisticRegression, DecisionTree, RandomForest, and GradientBoosting were trained and compared using evaluation metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1score and ROC-AUC. The final model helps telecom companies take proactive retention actions by identifying high-risk customers.
